# Data Structures and Algorithms

## About
Data structures and algorithms are a critical part of any programmer's
repertiore. As a result, several classic examples can be found within this repo
implemented in Java.

### Project Structure
prj.clark.cs.dsa is the root package for the entire project. All packages in
this section are relative to that.

* algo - Primary directory containg classical algorithms.
* struct - Primary directory containing classical data structures.

Each of these packages contain subpackages containing individual examples for
each structure or algorithm.

## Running
Each java file containing a concrete implementing class will have a main
method. Simply select which example you want to run, and go with it.

## Tests
A slew of tests exist. If you want to play around with the examples (and I
reccommend that you do), be sure to run these to make sure you don't break
anything.
